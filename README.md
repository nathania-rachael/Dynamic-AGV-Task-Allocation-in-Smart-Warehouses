# Dynamic-AGV-Task-Allocation-in-Smart-Warehouses
A CoppeliaSim-based system that assigns warehouse tasks to AGVs dynamically using Euclidean distance. The framework tracks AGV positions, detects new tasks, calculates distances, and allocates the nearest available AGV in real time, improving responsiveness and adaptability in smart warehouse environments.
